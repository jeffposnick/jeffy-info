# CDS '17 Retrospective

[Chrome Dev Summit 2017](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/) is behind us.
I spent most of the run-up to the event putting together my
["Workbox: Flexible PWA Libraries" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtuJ55tmjps),
but beyond that, I was also involved in [running on-site Performance Review
Clinics](https://twitter.com/jeffposnick/status/922899094053330944) that
attendees could sign up for.

It's always a privilege to meet with the developers who are building web apps
that I use every day, and to lend whatever guidance I could offer. Looking into
the performance of a large group of production websites gives insights that you
wouldn't get from just examining a site as a one-off. Patterns start to emerge
about common areas for improvement.

I wanted to publicly share a few high-level groupings based on those patterns,
and identify a handful of links for each area that contain useful guidance. It's
by no means exhaustive, but I can say that each of these links contains
solutions to a real-world performance issue that we identified during the
Performance Review Clinics.

# Linkdump!

Huge thanks go out to all the authors, many of whom I'm lucky enough to work
with.
