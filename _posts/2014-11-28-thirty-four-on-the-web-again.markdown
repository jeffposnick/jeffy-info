# About Me
I'm [Jeff Posnick](https://twitter.com/jeffposnick).
I've been working on the [Developer Relations](https://developers.google.com/careers/) team at Google NYC since 2007, first on the [Ads APIs](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/), then [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/), and currently on the [Open Web Platform](http://www.webplatform.org/).

# About this Blog
I've been blogging [elsewhere](http://thirtyfour.blogspot.com/) since 2003.
The other 34 started out using [Blosxom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blosxom) on a self-hosted web server.
I moved it over to Blogger eventually.

I'm going to keep [34](http://thirtyfour.blogspot.com/) around for personal topics.
This blog, [thirty-four](https://jeffy.info/), is going to focus on web technologies.
Serving it via HTTPS, and having full control over the HTML/JavaScript/CSS, means that I'll be able to take advantage of some of the new features being added to the web platform, like those powered by [service workers](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/index.html).

Stay tuned for a post detailing this blog's setup (spoiler alert: it's a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted on [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/), with the [CloudFlare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/) providing [HTTPS support](http://blog.cloudflare.com/easiest-ssl-ever-now-included-automatically-w/).)
